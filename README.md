# Sutro Skill

An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill for AI agents working with [Sutro](https://sutro.email) — the programmable email client. Gives your agent the ability to read threads, draft and send emails, post comments, manage your inbox, and interact with your calendar.

Install this skill to bring full email context into your agent. Works alongside Sutro's built-in AI or as a standalone external agent connected via webhook.
